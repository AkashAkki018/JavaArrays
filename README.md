📖 Introduction
Arrays are a fundamental part of Java programming, providing a powerful way to store and manipulate data. This repository covers everything you need to know about arrays, 
from basic concepts to advanced techniques.


📝 Array Basics
What is an Array?
An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of an array is established when the array is created. After creation, its length is fixed.

Creating an Array
java
Copy code
int[] myArray = new int[10];
Accessing Array Elements
java
Copy code
myArray[0] = 1; // Assigning value to the first element
int firstElement = myArray[0]; // Accessing the first element
